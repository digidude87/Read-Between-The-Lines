# Contributing.


please take a quick look at the [issues](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Read-Between-The-Lines/issues) tab.


If there's something on there you know how to fix, (it's usually simple stuff)

feel free to send me a request.


Otherwise just attach a helpful explanation to your pull requests.


## Thanks!
